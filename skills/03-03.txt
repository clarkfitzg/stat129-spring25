	Upload it to the server at ~/skills/03-03/GlobalSummaryTimeSeries-2021.pdf


3. (Can skip if you have points for parallel)
    The following command evaluates a bash script, passing in one particular file.

               bash /stat129/class/bash-script-examples/script2.sh /stat129/1750.csv.gz

    Modify it so that it runs in parallel over all the files listed in `ls /stat129/17*.csv.gz`.
    Save the results of --dry-run to the file ~/skills/03-03/q3.txt
