0. Use `mkdir` to make a directory ~/skills/04-14/ 

1. Using /opt/anaconda/bin/ipython, run the file /stat129/class/python/transform.py
   Use `cv` to transform the following new document:

        "Should we trust LLM's?"

   Save the resulting vector as one row in CSV format in ~/skills/04-14/q1.csv 
   Don't worry about a header row or writing the CSV from Python,
   just copy and paste from IPython into the CSV file.

   For example, if the input data were "Students tell LLM's everything", then
    ~/skills/04-14/q1.csv would contain the row:

        0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0


2. Building on above, call the inverse transform method on 

        np.array([[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]])

   Copy and paste the resulting terms in ~/skills/04-14/q2.txt 
   For example, if the input were np.array([[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0]]
    then ~/skills/04-14/q2.txt would contain the text

        do will


3. Copy /stat129/class/python/exp_cdf.py to ~/skills/04-14/exp_cdf.py
   Edit the file to use map() to call the function exp_cdf()
   on all elements of xx, and assign the result to y.
